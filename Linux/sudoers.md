**1. skp ALL=(appslens) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git pull**

- **Runas User:** `(appslens)`
- When `skp` uses sudo to run `git pull`, they will do so with the **privileges of the user `appslens`**. This means `skp` can only perform actions that `appslens` is authorized to do.

**2. skp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git pull**

- **Runas User:** `(ALL)`
- This is a more risky configuration. `(ALL)` signifies **all privileges**, essentially granting `skp` **root access** when they use sudo to run `git pull`. They can perform any action on the system.

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

|Feature|skp ALL=(appslens) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git pull|skp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git pull|
|---|---|---|
|Runas User|`appslens`|`ALL` (essentially root)|
|Privileges|Privileges of the user `appslens`|All privileges (root access)|
|Security|More secure (limited privileges)|Less secure (full root access)|

**Security Considerations:**

- The second command (`skp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD...`) is generally **not recommended** due to security concerns. Granting full root access without a password is risky.
- The first command (`skp ALL=(appslens) NOPASSWD...`) is a safer approach if `appslens` has the necessary permissions to perform the `git pull`. However, consider if `skp` can perform the pull with their own user permissions instead (avoiding sudo altogether).

**Recommendation:**

- If `skp` only needs to pull updates from a Git repository, and `appslens` has the necessary permissions, the first command can be acceptable. However, prioritize using `skp`'s own user permissions for the pull if possible.
- Avoid using `(ALL)` in the runas specification for sudo commands unless absolutely necessary.
- When using sudo, requiring a password for verification provides an extra layer of security.
