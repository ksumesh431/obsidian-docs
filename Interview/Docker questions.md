   

Certainly! Hereâ€™s a better-formatted version of the Docker interview questions and answers:

---

1. **Difference between an Image, Container, and Engine:**
    
    - **Image:** Think of it as a snapshot of a file system and the parameters needed to run a piece of software.
    - **Container:** An instance of an image, including the application and all its dependencies, running in isolation.
    - **Engine:** The core of Docker, facilitating the creation and management of containers.
2. **Docker command COPY vs ADD:**
    
    While both commands serve the purpose of copying files, `COPY` is more straightforward and recommended for general file copying. On the other hand, `ADD` has additional capabilities, such as extracting tarballs and copying remote URLs.
    
3. **Docker command CMD vs RUN:**
    
    In Docker, `CMD` is used to provide default arguments for the entry point, defining what will be run when the container starts. Conversely, `RUN` executes commands during the image build phase.
    
4. **How to Reduce Docker Image Size:**
    
    Efficient image size is crucial. Strategies include:
    
    - Using a minimal base image
    - Combining `RUN` commands
    - Cleaning up unnecessary files
    - Leveraging multi-stage builds to discard unneeded artifacts.
5. **What is a Docker Registry:**
    
    A repository for Docker images, enabling distribution and sharing. Docker Hub is a popular public registry.
    
6. **What is the Entry Point:**
    
    An instruction in a Dockerfile defining the default command to execute when a container starts.
    
7. **Difference Between Docker vs Hypervisor:**
    
    - Docker operates at the container level, sharing the host OS kernel and offering lightweight isolation.
    - Hypervisors operate at the virtual machine level.
8. **What is a Dockerfile:**
    
    A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and other configurations.
    
9. **What is Docker Compose:**
    
    Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container applications using a YAML file.
    
10. **How does Docker ensure security?**
	
	Docker provides security through isolation by using kernel namespaces and control groups. It also supports various security features such as user namespaces, seccomp, and AppArmor profiles.
