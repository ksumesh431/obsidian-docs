basic syntax https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn5vrUDYtyc



``` Go
if result := someFunction(); result == "expectedValue" { 
// Code to be executed if the result is as expected 
} else { 
// Code to be executed if the result is not as expected 
}
 ```


In this example, `someFunction()` is called, and its return value is assigned to the variable `result`. The expression `result == "expectedValue"` is then evaluated. If it is true, the code inside the block is executed. If it is false, the code inside the `else` block is executed.
