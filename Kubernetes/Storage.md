# Volumes and volumeMounts

- The host path is the path on the Node . (must be lowercase name)

- volumeMount is the the path inside the container where the volume should be mounted. Mention the Volume name to mount it.

# Persistent Volume 

In Kubernetes, a Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of networked storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It provides a way for pods to access data stored on a disk or network storage outside of their local file system.

Example:
``` 
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
	name: pv-log\
spec:
	persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain 
	accessModes: 
		- ReadWriteMany 
	capacity:
		storage: 100Mi
	hostPath:
		path: /pv/log

```

# Persistent Volume Claim

A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for storage made by a user.

> PVs and PVCs are cluster-wide resources, meaning they can be used by any pod in the cluster, not just a single namespace or deployment. This makes it possible to share storage resources across multiple applications, as well as providing a way to migrate data between different parts of your cluster.

### Once you create a PVC use it in a POD definition file by specifying the PVCÂ Claim name under persistentVolumeClaim section in the volumes section like this:
``` 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim

```

**The same is true for ReplicaSets or Deployments. Add this to the pod template section of a Deployment on ReplicaSet.


<u>A pvc wont terminate if a pod is using it.</u>

## Important properties while creating pvc

## Access Modes

<br/>


## PV Reclaim policies

1.  Retain: When a PVC is released or deleted, the underlying storage resource is not deleted and remains available for use by other PVCs. This is useful when you want to manually manage the lifecycle of your storage resources and want to keep data available even after a PVC has been deleted.
    
2.  Recycle: When a PVC is released or deleted, the underlying storage resource is marked for reuse. The data stored on the volume is not deleted immediately, but rather is marked for deletion. The data is only deleted after a subsequent PVC is created and bound to the volume and the new PVC explicitly requests the deletion of the previous data.
    
3.  Delete: When a PVC is released or deleted, the underlying storage resource is deleted immediately and the data is lost. This reclaim policy is useful when you want to automatically delete storage resources that are no longer in use.

# Storage Class

We can define a storage class for various storage provisioners like gcp, aws ebs etc.
If we define a storage class, then it automatically creates a pv when required. that is when a pvc with the storage class requests for storage.

### the "no-provisioner" local provisioner

> In Kubernetes, dynamic provisioning is a feature that allows automatic creation of storage resources on demand when a Pod requests them. Dynamic provisioning can be achieved using Storage Classes.
> 
> A Storage Class is an object in Kubernetes that defines the properties of a specific type of storage that can be used to dynamically provision Persistent Volumes (PVs). It defines parameters such as the type of storage, the access mode, and the provisioner that will be used to create the storage.
> 
> Here's how dynamic provisioning works in Kubernetes using Storage Classes:
> 
> 1.  A user creates a Pod and specifies a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) that requests a specific amount of storage with specific properties, such as access mode and storage class.
> 
> 2.  If a PV with the requested properties exists and is available, the PVC is bound to that PV, and the Pod can use the storage.
> 
> 3.  If a PV with the requested properties does not exist, Kubernetes uses the provisioner specified in the PVC's storage class to create a new PV that meets the requirements. The provisioner is responsible for creating and managing the underlying storage resource, such as a disk or a cloud-based storage service.
> 
> 4.  Once the new PV is created, the PVC is bound to it, and the Pod can use the storage.
> 
> 5.  When the Pod is deleted, the PV is released and can be reused by other Pods that request storage with similar properties.
> 
> 
> Dynamic provisioning using Storage Classes has several advantages over static provisioning:
> 
> -   Automation: Storage resources are created automatically on demand, without the need for manual intervention.
> 
> -   Efficiency: Storage resources are only created when they are needed, reducing the amount of wasted storage.
> 
> -   Flexibility: Users can request storage with specific properties, such as access mode and storage class, and the storage system will provide the appropriate resources.
> 
> 
> Overall, dynamic provisioning using Storage Classes is a powerful feature of Kubernetes that simplifies the management of storage resources for containerized applications.
